# Zinc+ memory-consistency backend

This module integrates [Zinc+](https://github.com/NethermindEth/zinc-plus)
(NethermindEth) as an **optional proof-system backend** for zkMemory's
memory-consistency argument, alongside the existing Halo2 (PLONK) circuits in
[`src/constraints`](../constraints). It is gated behind the `zinc` cargo
feature and follows the multi-backend layout established by
[`src/nova`](../nova) and [`src/supernova`](../supernova).

## Quick start

```rust
use zkmemory::zincplus::{prove_memory_consistency, verify_memory_consistency};

let trace = machine.trace();                    // time-ordered execution trace
let proof = prove_memory_consistency(&trace)?;  // succinct, transparent SNARK
verify_memory_consistency(&proof)?;
let bytes = proof.to_bytes()?;                  // transferable proof bytes
```

Or through the backend-agnostic seam, which lets code switch between Halo2
and Zinc+ without changing how traces are produced:

```rust
use zkmemory::backend::{Halo2Backend, MemoryConsistencyBackend, ZincPlusBackend};

let halo2 = Halo2Backend { k: 10 };
halo2.verify(&halo2.prove(&trace)?)?;

let zinc = ZincPlusBackend;
zinc.verify(&zinc.prove(&trace)?)?;
```

The input trace must satisfy the same contract the Halo2
`OriginalMemoryCircuit` places on the original trace: records in execution
order, `time_log[0] = 0`, strictly increasing `time_log`s (gaps allowed).
Traces produced by [`machine.trace()`](../machine.rs) satisfy this by
construction.

Build with `cargo build -p zkmemory --features zinc`. The feature requires a
`std` environment and Rust ≥ 1.85 (Zinc+ is an edition-2024 workspace); the
repository toolchain is pinned accordingly in [`rust-toolchain`](../../../rust-toolchain).

## What Zinc+ is

Zinc+ ([eprint 2026/855](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/855)) is a
**transparent, plausibly post-quantum SNARK for polynomial rings**. Instead
of embedding all constraints into one prime field, it expresses them over
`Q[X]`, `Z[X]` and several `F_q[X]` rings simultaneously, avoiding the
witness inflation of single-field SNARKs. Constraints are written in a
univariate-AIR (UAIR) dialect: per-row expressions over three column kinds
(binary polynomials, arbitrary polynomials, integers) with fixed row shifts
for transition constraints, compiled down to sumchecks and the Brakedown-style
Zip+ polynomial commitment scheme (Merkle trees + linear codes). There is
**no trusted setup**; all challenges — including the random ~192-bit prime
modulus the constraints are projected into — derive from a Blake3
Fiat-Shamir transcript.

## The statement proven

The proof attests knowledge of a witness containing *two orderings of the
same trace* — the time-ordered original trace `O` and its
`(address, time_log)`-sorted permutation `S`, each padded to `2^num_vars`
rows — satisfying all three sub-statements of the composed Halo2
`MemoryConsistencyCircuit`:

| sub-statement | Halo2 circuit | Zinc+ constraints |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| original-trace consistency: `time_log[0] = 0`, `time_log[i] < time_log[i+1]` | `OriginalMemoryCircuit` | `is_first` pins row 0's time limbs; a one-hot limb selector + slack limb enforce the strict `u64` increase |
| sorted-trace consistency: `(address, time_log)` strictly increases, first access (overall and per address) is a write, instructions boolean, reads return the previous value at the address | `SortedMemoryCircuit` | the lookup-free lexicographic comparison and read-check constraints described in [`uair.rs`](uair.rs) |
| `S` is a permutation of `O` | `PermutationCircuit` (PLONK shuffle) | a **Beneš switching network**: `2v - 1` layers of boolean-selected conditional swaps between rows `i` and `i + 2^k`, carrying the full record payload from `S` (network input) to `O` (network output) |

Both traces are witnesses; like the composed Halo2 circuit, the statement
has no trace-dependent public inputs (the verifier reconstructs the fixed
`is_first` and bit-indicator selector columns itself).

Randomized permutation arguments (PLONK shuffle, LogUp) are not expressible
in Zinc+ — there is no lookup layer yet, no verifier-randomness columns, and
committed cells are small integers fixed before the random prime is sampled,
so a grand-product accumulator over the proof field cannot even be
materialized. The Beneš network sidesteps randomness entirely: switch
equations are cell-exact, so each network state is *exactly* a permutation
of the previous one, and `multiset(O) = multiset(S)` holds with no soundness
error beyond the (negligible) probability that a small nonzero integer
vanishes mod the ~192-bit Fiat-Shamir-sampled prime. Routing bits are free
witnesses: a malicious router can only fail to prove, never prove a false
statement. This is the established deterministic RAM-checking technique of
challenge-less proof systems (Pantry, Buffet, xJsnark).

Addresses, values, `time_log`s and `stack_depth`s live in *binary
polynomial* columns: `BinaryPoly<32>` cells whose 32 coefficients are proven
boolean by Zinc+'s built-in booleanity argument, so every limb is
range-checked to `u32` for free — no lookup tables are needed anywhere.

Zinc+ exempts the very last row from constraints (its built-in last-row
selector); the witness builder therefore always keeps at least one padding
row, so **no real record ever occupies the exempt row**. Padding rows replay
the last *sorted* record as reads with `time_log`s continuing past the
global maximum, which satisfies both orderings' constraints and keeps the
two padded multisets equal. The exemption opens no hole in the network
either: row `2^v - 1` has every index bit set, so it is never the anchor
(upper) row of any switch, and all constraints binding it are anchored at
non-exempt rows.

## Security status — differences from the Halo2 backend

Users must understand two deliberate limitations of this integration:

1. **No zero-knowledge.** Zinc+ currently provides succinctness and
   transparency but no hiding: witness columns are committed and opened
   without masking. Treat the proof as potentially revealing the entire
   trace. Use the Halo2 backend when privacy is required.

2. **Research-grade upstream.** Zinc+ is unaudited and marked by its authors
   as for research/educational use. The dependency is pinned to one reviewed
   revision (see `[workspace.dependencies]`), and the security parameters in
   [`types.rs`](types.rs) (repetition factor 8, 100 column openings, 192-bit
   sampled prime) are the upstream research defaults, not audited production
   parameters.

The earlier v1 limitation — no in-SNARK permutation link between the sorted
and original traces — is **resolved**: the Beneš network enforces the full
composed Halo2 statement. The constraint-by-constraint soundness argument is
documented in [`uair.rs`](uair.rs) (module docs) and exercised by negative
tests in [`testcases.rs`](testcases.rs), including direct witness-tampering
attacks on the network states, switch bits, both trace orderings and the
transition slacks.

## Performance notes

The deterministic permutation argument is paid for in trace width: the
network adds `2v` states of 21 binary columns each (plus one switch column
per layer), so the committed trace has `~42v + 2` binary columns instead of
the ~20 of the consistency-only v1 backend. Measured on commodity hardware
(release mode, single-threaded): 200 records (`v = 8`) prove in ~1.3 s and
verify in ~0.12 s with a ~9 MiB proof; 900 records (`v = 10`) prove in
~6.4 s and verify in ~0.2 s with a ~11.5 MiB proof. Linear-code commitments
have large constants, so proofs are far bigger than pairing-based SNARK
proofs. The verifier additionally pays `O(2^{v-1})` field operations per
large-stride shifted column when evaluating Zinc+'s shift predicates, which
is why [`MAX_NUM_VARS`](uair.rs) is 16 (`≤ 65 535` records): beyond that,
verification time becomes impractical and the permutation argument should
instead migrate to upstream's lookup layer once it lands (see below).

The upstream `parallel` (rayon) and `simd` features can be forwarded later
if throughput becomes a concern.

## Migration plan (tracking upstream Zinc+ maturity)

This integration deliberately isolates everything Zinc+-specific behind
`zkmemory::backend::MemoryConsistencyBackend` and this module, so upstream
progress can be adopted incrementally:

- **When Zinc+ gains zero-knowledge** (witness masking): bump the pinned
  revision, enable the hiding mode in `types.rs`/`prover.rs`; the UAIR and
  the public API stay unchanged.
- **When Zinc+ lands its lookup/LogUp layer**: replace the Beneš network
  with a randomized multiset argument to reclaim the `~40v` extra committed
  columns and lift `MAX_NUM_VARS`; the statement and public API stay
  unchanged.
- **When upstream publishes audited parameters**: update `types.rs`
  accordingly (`REP_FACTOR`, `NUM_COLUMN_OPENINGS`, field size).
- **Halo2 parity work in the other direction**: the Halo2 backend currently
  checks the composed circuit with `MockProver` only (the crate has a real
  prover just for the permutation sub-circuit); giving it a real
  transferable proof artifact would make the two backends fully
  interchangeable behind the trait.
